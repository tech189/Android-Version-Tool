# Android Version Tool

#### A tool to look up Android versions

The tool has a dictionary of all the Android versions but it needs updating from time to time as new versions come out.

## Files

### android.py

This uses the command line and can be run using:

<code>python android.py</code>

<b>NB: You must use Python 3!</b>

You can quit the program by pressing <code>Ctrl-C</code>.

### androidgui.py

This is the tool but with a proper GUI made in Tkinter. It's not great.

Just start the program with:

<code>python androidgui.py</code>

<b>NB: You must use Python 3!</b>

### android.ico

This is just an icon for the GUI. The program will throw an error if the icon isn't in the same directory. Probably should fix that.
